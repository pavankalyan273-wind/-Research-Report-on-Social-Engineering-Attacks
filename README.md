# -Research-Report-on-Social-Engineering-Attacks

## Introduction
Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. In the realm of cybersecurity, attackers use social engineering to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or compromising systems.

## Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### 1. *Phishing*
Phishing is one of the most common forms. Attackers impersonate legitimate institutions through email, SMS, or websites to steal sensitive data like login credentials or financial information.

*Example*: In 2016, employees at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) were victims of a phishing attack where attackers sent fake Google login pages, leading to a major email leak.

### 2. *Pretexting*
This involves the attacker creating a fabricated scenario or "pretext" to steal information. This often includes impersonation (e.g., pretending to be IT support).

*Example*: In 2020, Twitter was compromised when attackers impersonated IT staff in a phone-based pretexting attack, gaining access to internal tools and posting from high-profile accounts.

### 3. *Baiting*
Attackers leave a physical or digital "bait" — such as infected USB drives or download links — in the hope someone will take the bait and run malicious code.

*Example*: A test by the University of Illinois showed that nearly 50% of dropped USB drives were picked up and plugged in by unsuspecting individuals.

### 4. *Tailgating (Piggybacking)*
An unauthorized person gains access to a restricted area by following an authorized person.

*Example*: In 2011, a hacker posed as a pizza delivery guy to gain entry into a data center, exploiting friendly employee behavior.

## Impact on Organizations
- *Data Breaches* (e.g., Yahoo, DNC)
- *Financial Losses* (e.g., business email compromise scams cost $26B between 2016-2019 – FBI report)
- *Reputation Damage*
- *Loss of Customer Trust*

## Prevention Measures

1. *Employee Training*: Regular security awareness training.
2. *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)*: Reduces the risk even if credentials are stolen.
3. *Simulated Phishing Campaigns*: Helps test employee awareness.
4. *Verification Protocols*: Always verify before sharing sensitive info.
5. *Physical Security Policies*: Prevent tailgating and baiting.

## Conclusion
Social engineering remains one of the most effective attack vectors due to its reliance on human psychology. Organizations must prioritize employee education and implement strict policies to reduce their risk.
